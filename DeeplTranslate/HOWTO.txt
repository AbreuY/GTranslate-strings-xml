How to use DEEPL.COM to translate Android string resource XML files.

* Why? * 

Deepl.com offers higher quality translations than translate.google.com 
between FRENCH, GERMAN, ENGLISCH, DUTCH, ITALIAN, SPANISH and POLISH.

* How? * 

Non-commercial use is restricted to explicitely clicking on the website,
automated HTML-requests are available as a payed service only. 

Therefore:

1.) "python3.5 dtranslate_xml_to_text.py" extracts all strings to a text file.
2.) Copy-paste the text file's content on the DEEPL.COM website.
3.) Copy-paste the result to another text file.
4.) "python3.5 dtranslate_text_to_xml.py" puts the translated strings into a 
    new XML file. 

It is important that both Python files get the XML structure from the same 
input file.
